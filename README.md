## Project Objective:
The objective of the project is to create a machine learning model. We are doing a supervised learning and our aim is to do predictive analysis to predict San Francisco Airbnb Rental Pricing.

## Problem Statement:
* Airbnb is an online marketplace which allows users to post listings on their website and it earns commissions from every booking.
* At present when someone wants to list an Airbnb rental, they have to manually analyze similar properties near their location and decide the price themselves.
* Idea of our project is to form a model to estimate what the correct price of their rental should be given the features of their property.

## Data Collection:
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle.

The main packages used are numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn.  

## Deployemnt:
